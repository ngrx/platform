# These options are enabled when running on CI
# We do this by copying this file to /etc/bazel.bazelrc at the start of the build.

# Don't be spammy in the logs
build --noshow_progress

# Don't run manual tests
test --test_tag_filters=-manual

# Print all the options that apply to the build.
# This helps us diagnose which options override others
# (e.g. /etc/bazel.bazelrc vs. tools/bazel.rc)
build --announce_rc

# Prevent unstable environment variables from tainting cache keys
build --experimental_strict_action_env

# Workaround https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/3645
# Bazel doesn't calculate the memory ceiling correctly when running under Docker.
# Limit Bazel to consuming resources that fit in CircleCI "medium" class which is the default:
# https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#resource_class
build --jobs=10 --local_resources=3072,2.0,1.0

# Also limit Bazel's own JVM heap to stay within our 4G container limit
startup --host_jvm_args=-Xmx2G

# Retry in the event of flakes, eg. https://circleci.com/gh/angular/angular/31309
test --flaky_test_attempts=2
