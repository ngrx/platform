## Submitting Pull Requests

**Please follow these basic steps to simplify pull request reviews - if you don't you'll probably just be asked to anyway.**

* Please rebase your branch against the current master
* Run the `Setup` command to make sure your development dependencies are up-to-date
* Please ensure the test suite passes before submitting a PR
* If you've added new functionality, **please** include tests which validate its behavior
* Make reference to possible [issues](https://github.com/ngrx/platform/issues) on PR comment

## Submitting bug reports

* Search through issues to see if a previous issue has already been reported and/or fixed.
* Provide a _small_ reproduction using a [plunker template](http://plnkr.co/edit/tpl:757r6L?p=preview) or github repo.
* Please detail the affected browser(s) and operating system(s).
* Please be sure to state which version of Angular, node and npm you're using.

## Submitting New features

* We value keeping the API surface small and concise, which factors into whether new features are accepted.
* Submit an issue with the prefix `RFC: ` with your feature request.
* The feature will be discussed and considered.
* Once the PR is submitted, it will be reviewed and merged once approved.


## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/ngrx).
Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.
