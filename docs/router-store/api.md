## Navigation actions

Navigation actions are not provided as part of the router package. You provide your own
custom navigation actions that use the `Router` within effects to navigate.

```ts
import { Action } from '@ngrx/store';
import { NavigationExtras } from '@angular/router';

export const GO = '[Router] Go';
export const BACK = '[Router] Back';
export const FORWARD = '[Router] Forward';

export class Go implements Action {
  readonly type = GO;

  constructor(public payload: {
    path: any[];
    query?: object;
    extras?: NavigationExtras;
  }) {}
}

export class Back implements Action {
  readonly type = BACK;
}

export class Forward implements Action {
  readonly type = FORWARD;
}

export type Actions
  = Go
  | Back
  | Forward;
```

```ts
import * as RouterActions from './actions/router';

store.dispatch(new RouterActions.Go({
  path: ['/path', { routeParam: 1 }],
  query: { page: 1 },
  extras: { replaceUrl: false }
});

store.dispatch(new RouterActions.Back());

store.dispatch(new RouterActions.Forward());
```
## Effects

```ts
import 'rxjs/add/operator/do';
import 'rxjs/add/operator/map';
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Router } from '@angular/router';
import { Location } from '@angular/common';
import { Effect, Actions } from '@ngrx/effects';
import * as RouterActions from './actions/router';

@Injectable()
export class RouterEffects {
  @Effect({ dispatch: false })
  navigate$ = this.actions$.ofType(RouterActions.GO)
    .map((action: RouterActions.Go) => action.payload)
    .do(({ path, query: queryParams, extras})
      => this.router.navigate(path, { queryParams, ...extras }));

  @Effect({ dispatch: false })
  navigateBack$ = this.actions$.ofType(RouterActions.BACK)
    .do(() => this.location.back());

  @Effect({ dispatch: false })
  navigateForward$ = this.actions$.ofType(RouterActions.FORWARD)
    .do(() => this.location.forward());    

  constructor(
    private actions$: Actions,
    private router: Router,
    private location: Location
  ) {}
}
```
## Custom Router State Serializer

During each navigation cycle, a `RouterNavigationAction` is dispatched with a snapshot of the state in its payload, the `RouterStateSnapshot`. The `RouterStateSnapshot` is a large complex structure, containing many pieces of information about the current state and what's rendered by the router. This can cause performance
issues when used with the Store Devtools. In most cases, you may only need a piece of information from the `RouterStateSnapshot`. In order to pare down the `RouterStateSnapshot` provided during navigation, you provide a custom serializer for the snapshot to only return what you need to be added to the payload and store.

Additionally, the router state snapshot is a mutable object, which can cause issues when developing with [store freeze](https://github.com/brandonroberts/ngrx-store-freeze) to prevent direct state mutations. This can be avoided by using a custom serializer.

To use the time-traveling debugging in the Devtools, you must return an object containing the `url` when using the `routerReducer`.

```ts
import { StoreModule, ActionReducerMap } from '@ngrx/store';
import { Params, RouterStateSnapshot } from '@angular/router';
import {
  StoreRouterConnectingModule,
  routerReducer,
  RouterReducerState,
  RouterStateSerializer
} from '@ngrx/router-store';

export interface RouterStateUrl {
  url: string;
  params: Params;
  queryParams: Params;
}

export interface State {
  routerReducer: RouterReducerState<RouterStateUrl>;
}

export class CustomSerializer implements RouterStateSerializer<RouterStateUrl> {
  serialize(routerState: RouterStateSnapshot): RouterStateUrl {
    let route = routerState.root;
    while (route.firstChild) {
      route = route.firstChild;
    }

    const { url } = routerState;
    const queryParams = routerState.root.queryParams;
    const params = route.params;

    // Only return an object including the URL, params and query params
    // instead of the entire snapshot
    return { url, params, queryParams };
  }
}

export const reducers: ActionReducerMap<State> = {
  routerReducer: routerReducer
};

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    StoreModule.forRoot(reducers),
    RouterModule.forRoot([
      // routes
    ]),
    StoreRouterConnectingModule
  ],
  providers: [
    { provide: RouterStateSerializer, useClass: CustomSerializer }
  ]
})
export class AppModule { }
```
