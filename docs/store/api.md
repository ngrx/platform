## Initial State

Configure initial state when providing Store. `initialState` can be either the actual state or a function that returns the initial state:

```ts
import { StoreModule } from '@ngrx/store';
import { reducers } from './reducers';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    StoreModule.forRoot(reducers, {
      initialState: {
        counter: 3,
      },
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### Initial State and Ahead of Time (AoT) Compilation

Angular AoT requires all symbols referenced in the decorator metadata to be statically analyzable. For this reason, we cannot dynamically inject state at runtime with AoT unless we provide `initialState` as a function. Thus the above `NgModule` definition simply changes to:

```ts
// Pretend this is dynamically injected at runtime
const initialStateFromSomewhere = { counter: 3 };

// Static state
const initialState = { counter: 2 };

// In this function dynamic state slices, if they exist, will overwrite static state at runtime.
export function getInitialState() {
  return { ...initialState, ...initialStateFromSomewhere };
}

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    StoreModule.forRoot(reducers, { initialState: getInitialState })
  ]
})
```

## Meta-reducers

@ngrx/store composes your map of reducers into a single reducer. 

>  Developers can think of meta-reducers as hooks into the action->reducer pipeline. Meta-reducers allow developers to pre-process actions before *normal* reducers are invoked.

Use the `metaReducers` configuration option to provide an array of meta-reducers that are composed from right to left.

Note: Meta-reducers in NgRx are similar to middleware used in Redux.

```ts
import { StoreModule, ActionReducer, MetaReducer } from '@ngrx/store';
import { reducers } from './reducers';

// console.log all actions
export function debug(reducer: ActionReducer<any>): ActionReducer<any> {
  return function(state, action) {
    console.log('state', state);
    console.log('action', action);

    return reducer(state, action);
  };
}

export const metaReducers: MetaReducer<any>[] = [debug];

@NgModule({
  imports: [StoreModule.forRoot(reducers, { metaReducers })],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

## Feature Module State Composition

Store uses fractal state management, which provides state composition through feature modules,
loaded eagerly or lazily. Provide feature states using the `StoreModule.forFeature` method. This
method defines the name of the feature state and the reducers that make up the state. The same `initialState`
and `metaReducers` configuration options are available.

```ts
// feature.module.ts
import { StoreModule, ActionReducerMap } from '@ngrx/store';

export const reducers: ActionReducerMap<any> = {
  subFeatureA: featureAReducer,
  subFeatureB: featureBReducer,
};

@NgModule({
  imports: [StoreModule.forFeature('featureName', reducers)],
})
export class FeatureModule {}
```

The feature state is added to the global application state once the feature is loaded. The feature state can then be selected using the [createFeatureSelector](./selectors.md#createFeatureSelector) convenience method.

## Feature Module Reducers and AOT

Developers can use: 
* `StoreModule.forFeature(<name>, <reducers map>, { initialState : <reducers initial state map>})`. 
*  `StoreModule.forFeature(<name>, <reducers map> )`.

Due to AOT constraints, however, the following is not allowed:

```console
StoreModule.forFeature(<name>, combineReducers(<reducers map>, <reducers initial state map>))
```

Since the compiler needs to be able to statically analyze your code, you canâ€™t call functions when defining metadata in the NgModule. In such cases, InjectionTokens are needed (see below):

Fortunately - with Feature modules - we can avoid injection tokens using the following approach:

```ts
const initialStateA: Permissions = {
  list: A[],
  editMode: false
};
const _reducerA: ActionReducerMap<Permissions> = {
  list: A[],
  editMode: editModeReducer
};

/**
 * Create `metaReducer` 1x... 
 * while `reducerA()` is called for every action.
 */
const metaReducer = combineReducers(_reducerA, initialStateA);

export function reducerA(state, action) {
	return metaReducer(state, action);
}
```

and then the following will work with AOT:

```ts
import { reducerA } from './state/a.reducer';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    CommonModule,
    StoreModule.forFeature('a', reducerA),
  ],
})
```

## Injecting Reducers

To inject the root reducers into your application, use an `InjectionToken` and a `Provider` to register the reducers through dependency injection.

```ts
import { NgModule, InjectionToken } from '@angular/core';
import { StoreModule, ActionReducerMap } from '@ngrx/store';

import { SomeService } from './some.service';
import * as fromRoot from './reducers';

export const REDUCER_TOKEN = new InjectionToken<
  ActionReducerMap<fromRoot.State>
>('Registered Reducers');

export function getReducers(someService: SomeService) {
  return someService.getReducers();
}

@NgModule({
  imports: [StoreModule.forRoot(REDUCER_TOKEN)],
  providers: [
    {
      provide: REDUCER_TOKEN,
      deps: [SomeService],
      useFactory: getReducers,
    },
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Reducers are also injected when composing state through feature modules.

```ts
import { NgModule, InjectionToken } from '@angular/core';
import { StoreModule, ActionReducerMap } from '@ngrx/store';

import * as fromFeature from './reducers';

export const FEATURE_REDUCER_TOKEN = new InjectionToken<
  ActionReducerMap<fromFeature.State>
>('Feature Reducers');

export function getReducers(): ActionReducerMap<fromFeature.State> {
  // map of reducers
  return {};
}

@NgModule({
  imports: [StoreModule.forFeature('feature', FEATURE_REDUCER_TOKEN)],
  providers: [
    {
      provide: FEATURE_REDUCER_TOKEN,
      useFactory: getReducers,
    },
  ],
})
export class FeatureModule {}
```

## Injecting Meta-Reducers


To inject 'middleware' meta reducers, use the `META_REDUCERS` injection token exported in
the Store API and a `Provider` to register the meta reducers through dependency
injection.

```ts
import { MetaReducer, META_REDUCERS } from '@ngrx/store';
import { SomeService } from './some.service';
import * as fromRoot from './reducers';

export function getMetaReducers(some: SomeService): MetaReducer<fromRoot.State>[] {
  // return array of meta reducers;
}

@NgModule({
  providers: [
    {
      provide: META_REDUCERS,
      deps: [SomeService],
      useFactory: getMetaReducers,
    },
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```
