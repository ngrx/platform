# @ngrx example application

Example application utilizing @ngrx libraries, showcasing common patterns and best practices.
Take a look at the [live app](https://ngrx.github.io/platform/example-app/).

This app is a book collection manager. The user can authenticate, use the Google Books API to search for
books and add them to their collection. This application utilizes [@ngrx/db](https://github.com/ngrx/db)
to persist the collection across sessions; [@ngrx/store](https://github.com/ngrx/store) to manage
the state of the app and to cache requests made to the Google Books API;
[@angular/router](https://github.com/angular/angular) to manage navigation between routes;
[@ngrx/effects](https://github.com/ngrx/effects) to isolate side effects.

Built with [@angular/cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
