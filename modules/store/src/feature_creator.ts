/**
 * @description
 * A function that accepts a feature name and a feature reducer, and creates
 * a feature selector and a selector for each feature state property.
 *
 * @param featureConfig An object that contains a feature name and a feature reducer.
 * @returns An object that contains a feature name, a feature reducer,
 * a feature selector, and a selector for each feature state property.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * **With Application State**
 *
 * ```ts
 * interface AppState {
 *   products: ProductsState;
 * }
 *
 * interface ProductsState {
 *   products: Product[];
 *   selectedId: string | null;
 * }
 *
 * const initialState: ProductsState = {
 *   products: [],
 *   selectedId: null,
 * };
 *
 * // AppState is passed as a generic argument
 * const productsFeature = createFeature<AppState>({
 *   name: 'products',
 *   reducer: createReducer(
 *     initialState,
 *     on(ProductsApiActions.loadSuccess(state, { products }) => ({
 *       ...state,
 *       products,
 *     }),
 *   ),
 * });
 *
 * const {
 *   selectProductsState, // type: MemoizedSelector<AppState, ProductsState>
 *   selectProducts, // type: MemoizedSelector<AppState, Product[]>
 *   selectSelectedId, // type: MemoizedSelector<AppState, string | null>
 * } = productsFeature;
 * ```
 *
 * **Without Application State**
 *
 * ```ts
 * const productsFeature = createFeature({
 *   name: 'products',
 *   reducer: createReducer(initialState),
 * });
 *
 * const {
 *   selectProductsState, // type: MemoizedSelector<Record<string, any>, ProductsState>
 *   selectProducts, // type: MemoizedSelector<Record<string, any>, Product[]>
 *   selectSelectedId, // type: MemoizedSelector<Record<string, any, string | null>
