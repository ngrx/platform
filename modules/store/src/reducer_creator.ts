/**
 * @description
 * Creates a reducer function to handle state transitions.
 *
 * Reducer creators reduce the explicitness of reducer functions with switch statements.
 *
 * @param initialState Provides a state value if the current state is `undefined`, as it is initially.
 * @param ons Associations between actions and state changes.
 * @returns A reducer function.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * - Must be used with `ActionCreator`'s (returned by `createAction`). Cannot be used with class-based action creators.
 * - The returned `ActionReducer` should additionally be wrapped with another function, if you are using View Engine AOT.
 * In case you are using Ivy (or only JIT View Engine) the extra wrapper function is not required.
 *
 * **Declaring a reducer creator**
 *
 * ```ts
 * export const reducer = createReducer(
 *   initialState,
 *   on(
 *     featureActions.actionOne,
 *     featureActions.actionTwo,
 *     (state, { updatedValue }) => ({ ...state, prop: updatedValue })
 *   ),
 *   on(featureActions.actionThree, () => initialState);
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * **Declaring a reducer creator using a wrapper function (Only needed if using View Engine AOT)**
 *
 * ```ts
 * const featureReducer = createReducer(
 *   initialState,
 *   on(
 *     featureActions.actionOne,
 *     featureActions.actionTwo,
 *     (state, { updatedValue }) => ({ ...state, prop: updatedValue })
 *   ),
 *   on(featureActions.actionThree, () => initialState);
 * );
 *
 * export function reducer(state: State | undefined, action: Action) {
 *   return featureReducer(state, action);
 * }
