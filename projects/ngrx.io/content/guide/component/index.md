# @ngrx/component

Component is a library for building reactive Angular templates.
It provides a set of declarables that can work with or without `zone.js`.
They give more control over rendering and provide further reactivity for Angular applications.

## Key Concepts

- Rendering observable events in a performant way.
- Displaying different content based on the current state of an observable.
- Creating readable templates by using aliases for nested properties.
- Building fully reactive Angular applications regardless of whether `zone.js` is present or not.
