# @ngrx/component

Component is a set of primitive reactive helpers to enable fully reactive, fully zone-less applications. They give more control over rendering, and provide further reactivity for Angular applications.

<div class="alert is-critical">

This package is experimental and may change during development.

</div>

## Key Concepts

Rendering happens in the template only:
  - [Push Pipe](guide/component/push)
  - [Let Directive](guide/component/let)

## Installation

Detailed installation instructions can be found on the [Installation](guide/component/install) page.
