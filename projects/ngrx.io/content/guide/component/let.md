# ngrxLet Structural Directive

The `*ngrxLet` directive serves a convenient way of binding observables to a view context (a dom element scope).
It also helps with several internal processing under the hood.

Same as [PushPipe](guide/component/push), it also respects ViewEngine as well as Ivy's new rendering API.

## Comparison with Async Pipe

The current way of binding an observable to the view looks like that:

```html
<ng-container *ngIf="observableNumber$ | async as n">
  <app-number [number]="n">
  </app-number>
  <app-number-special [number]="n">
  </app-number-special>
</ng-container>
 ```

The problem is `*ngIf` is also interfering with rendering and in case of a falsy value the component would be hidden.

The `*ngrxLet` directive takes over several things while making it more convenient and safe to work with streams in the template.

`<ng-container *ngrxLet="observableNumber$ as c"></ng-container>`

```html
<ng-container *ngrxLet="observableNumber$ as n">
  <app-number [number]="n">
  </app-number>
</ng-container>

<ng-container *ngrxLet="observableNumber$; let n">
  <app-number [number]="n">
  </app-number>
</ng-container>
```

In addition to that it provides us information from the whole observable context.
We can track the observables:

- next value
- error value
- complete state

```html
<ng-container *ngrxLet="observableNumber$; let n; let e = $error, let c = $complete">
  <app-number [number]="n"  *ngIf="!e && !c">
  </app-number>
  <ng-container *ngIf="e">
  There is an error: {{e}}
  </ng-container>
  <ng-container *ngIf="c">
  Observable completed: {{c}}
  </ng-container>
</ng-container>
```

## Included Features

- binding is always present. (`*ngIf="truthy$"`)
- it takes away the multiple usages of the `async` or `ngrxPush` pipe
- a unified/structured way of handling null and undefined
- triggers change-detection differently if `zone.js` is present or not (`ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges` or `ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck`)
- triggers change-detection differently if ViewEngine or Ivy is present (`ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges` or `ÉµdetectChanges`)
- distinct same values in a row (distinctUntilChanged operator),
