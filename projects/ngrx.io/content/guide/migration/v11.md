# V11 Update Guide

## Angular CLI update

NgRx supports using the Angular CLI `ng update` command to update your dependencies. Migration schematics are run to make the upgrade smoother. These schematics will fix some of the breaking changes.

To update your packages to the latest released version, run the command below.

```sh
ng update @ngrx/store
```

## Dependencies

Version 11 has the minimum version requirements:

- Angular version 11.x
- Angular CLI version 11.x
- TypeScript version 4.0.x
- RxJS version 6.5.x

## Breaking changes

### @ngrx/store

#### Stricter `props` for `createAction`

`createAction` doesn't allow `{}` as a `props` type anymore, because `{}` is compatible with primitive types.

BEFORE:

```ts
const customerPageLoaded = createAction('[Customer Page] Loaded', props<{}>());

customerPageLoaded({}); // ✔️
customerPageLoaded({ foo: 'bar' }); // ✔️
customerPageLoaded(0); // 👈 no error
customerPageLoaded(false); // 👈 no error
```

AFTER:

```ts
const customerPageLoaded = createAction(
  '[Customer Page] Loaded',
  props<Record<string, unknown>>(),
);
```

### @ngrx/entity

#### Removed `addAll` in favor of `setAll`

To overwrite the entities, we previously used the `addAll` method but the method name was confusing.

BEFORE:

```ts
adapter.addAll(action.entities, state);
```

AFTER:

The new method name `setAll` describes the intention better.

```ts
adapter.setAll(action.entities, state);
```
