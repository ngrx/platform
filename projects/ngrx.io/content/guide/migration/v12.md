# V12 Update Guide

## Angular CLI update

NgRx supports using the Angular CLI `ng update` command to update your dependencies. Migration schematics are run to make the upgrade smoother. These schematics will fix some of the breaking changes.

To update your packages to the latest released version, run the command below.

```sh
ng update @ngrx/store
```

## Dependencies

Version 12 has the minimum version requirements:

- Angular version 12.x
- Angular CLI version 12.x
- TypeScript version 4.2.x
- RxJS version 6.5.x

## Deprecations

### @ngrx/store

#### Selectors With Props

Selectors with props are deprecated in favor of "normal" factory selectors.
Factory selectors have the following benefits:

- easier to write and to teach
- selectors are typed
- child selectors are correctly memoized

BEFORE:

```ts
const selectCustomer = createSelector(
    selectCustomers,
    (customers, props: { customerId: number }) => {
      return customers[customerId];
    }
);

// Or if the selector is already defined as a factory selector

const selectCustomer = () =>
  createSelector(
    selectCustomers,
    (customers, props: { customerId: number }) => {
      return customers[customerId];
    }
  );
â€‹```

AFTER:

```ts
const selectCustomer = (customerId: number) =>
  createSelector(
    selectCustomers,
    (customers) => {
      return customers[customerId];
    }
  );
```
