# V15 Update Guide

## Angular CLI update

NgRx supports using the Angular CLI `ng update` command to update your dependencies. Migration schematics are run to make the upgrade smoother. These schematics will fix some of the breaking changes.

To update your packages to the latest released version, run the command below.

```sh
ng update @ngrx/store@15
```

## Dependencies

Version 15 has the minimum version requirements:

- Angular version 15.x
- Angular CLI version 15.x
- TypeScript version 4.8.x
- RxJS version ^6.5.3 || ^7.5.0

## Breaking changes

### @ngrx/store

The projector function on the selector is type-safe by default.

BEFORE:

The projector is not type-safe by default, allowing for potential mismatch types in the projector function.

```ts
const mySelector = createSelector(
  () => 'one',
  () => 2,
  (one, two) => 3
)

mySelector.projector() // <- type is projector(...args: any[]): number
```

AFTER:

The projector is strict by default, but can be bypassed with an `any` generic parameter.

```ts
const mySelector = createSelector(
  () => 'one',
  () => 2,
  (one, two) => 3
)

mySelector.projector() // <- Results in type error. Type is projector(s1: string, s2: number): number
```

To retain previous behavior

```ts
const mySelector = createSelector(
  () => 'one',
  () => 2,
  (one, two) => 3
)

(mySelector.projector as any)()
```

The projector method has become strict for selectors with props

BEFORE:

You could pass any arguments to the projector method

```ts
const selector = createSelector(
  selectString, // returning a string
  selectNumber, // returning a number
  (s, n, prefix: string) => {
    return prefix + s.repeat(n);
  }
)

// you could pass any argument
selector.projector(1, 'a', true);
```

AFTER:

```ts
const selector = createSelector(
  selectString, // returning a string
  selectNumber, // returning a number
  (s, n, prefix: string) => {
    return prefix + s.repeat(n);
  }
)

// this throws
selector.projector(1, 'a', true);
// this does not throw because the arguments have the correct type
selector.projector(1, 'a', 'prefix');
```

### @ngrx/effects

The @Effect decorator is removed

BEFORE:

Defining an effect is done with @Effect

```ts
@Effect()
data$ = this.actions$.pipe();
```

A migration was added in the v13 release to upgrade existing codebases to the `createEffect` function.

AFTER:

Defining an effect is done with createEffect

```ts
data$ = createEffect(() => this.actions$.pipe());
```

The signature of `provideEffects` is changed to expect a
spreaded array of effects.

BEFORE:

`provideEffects` expected the effects to be passed as an array.

```ts
// single effect
provideEffects([MyEffect])

// multiple effects
provideEffects([MyEffect, MySecondEffect])
```ts

AFTER:

`provideEffects` expects the effects as a spreaded array as argument.

```ts
// single effect
provideEffects(MyEffect)

// multiple effects
provideEffects(MyEffect, MySecondEffect)
```

## @ngrx/component

 `ReactiveComponentModule` is removed in favor of `LetModule` and `PushModule`.

BEFORE:

```ts
import { ReactiveComponentModule } from '@ngrx/component';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    // ... other imports
    ReactiveComponentModule,
  ],
})
export class MyFeatureModule {}
```

AFTER:

```ts
import { LetModule, PushModule } from '@ngrx/component';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    // ... other imports
    LetModule,
    PushModule,
  ],
})
export class MyFeatureModule {}
