# V19 Update Guide

## Angular CLI update

NgRx supports using the Angular CLI `ng update` command to update your dependencies. Migration schematics are run to make the upgrade smoother. These schematics will fix some of the breaking changes.

To update your packages to the latest released version, run the command below.

```sh
ng update @ngrx/store@19
```

## Dependencies

Version 19 has the minimum version requirements:

- Angular version 19.x
- Angular CLI version 19.x
- TypeScript version 5.6.x
- RxJS version ^6.5.x || ^7.5.0

## Breaking changes

### Signals

#### Throw error in dev mode on state mutation

The `patchState` method applies a deep freeze on the state in dev mode.
If you try to update the state directly, it will throw an error in dev mode.

BEFORE:

```ts
const userState = signalState(initialState);
patchState(userState, (state) => {
  // mutable change which went through
  state.user.firstName = 'mutable change';
  return state;
});
```

AFTER:

```ts
const userState = signalState(initialState);
patchState(userState, (state) => {
  // mutable change throws in dev mode
  state.user.firstName = 'mutable change'; 
  return state;
});
```

To fix the error, update the state in an immutable way.

```ts
const userState = signalState(initialState);
patchState(userState, (state) => {
  return {
    ...state,
    user: {
      ...state.user,
      // immutable change which went through
      firstName: 'immutable change', 
    },
  };
});
```

#### `computed` is replaced with `props`

To support more cases, the `props` property is added to  `signalStoreFeature`, which replaces the existing `computed` property.
This change has an ng-update schematic that automatically updates your code.

- The `computed` property in the `SignalStoreFeature` type is renamed to `props`.
- The `computed` property in the `signalStoreFeature` method is renamed to `props`.
- The `EntityComputed` and `NamedEntityComputed` types in the `entities` plugin are renamed to `EntityProps` and `NamedEntityProps`.

BEFORE:

```ts
import { computed, Signal } from '@angular/core';
import {
  signalStoreFeature,
  SignalStoreFeature,
  type,
  withComputed,
} from '@ngrx/signals';
import { EntityComputed } from '@ngrx/signals/entities';

export function withTotalEntities<Entity>(): SignalStoreFeature<
  { state: {}, computed: EntityComputed<Entity>, methods: {} },
  { state: {}, computed: { total: Signal<number> }, methods: {} },
> {
  return signalStoreFeature(
    { computed: type<EntityComputed<Entity>>() },
    withComputed(({ entities }) => ({
      total: computed(() => entities().length),
    })),
  );
}
```

AFTER:

```ts
import { computed, Signal } from '@angular/core';
import {
  signalStoreFeature,
  SignalStoreFeature,
  type,
  withComputed,
} from '@ngrx/signals';
import { EntityProps } from '@ngrx/signals/entities';

export function withTotalEntities<Entity>(): SignalStoreFeature<
  { state: {}, props: EntityProps<Entity>, methods: {} },
  { state: {}, props: { total: Signal<number> }, methods: {} },
> {
  return signalStoreFeature(
    { props: type<EntityProps<Entity>>() },
    withComputed(({ entities }) => ({
      total: computed(() => entities().length),
    })),
  );
}
```

#### Rename `rxMethod.unsubscribe()` to `rxMethod.destroy()`

The `unsubscribe` method from `rxMethod` is renamed to `destroy`.

BEFORE:

```ts
const logNumber = rxMethod<number>(tap(console.log));

const num1Ref = logNumber(interval(1_000));
const num2Ref = logNumber(interval(2_000));

// destroy `num1Ref` after 2 seconds
setTimeout(() => num1Ref.unsubscribe(), 2_000);

// destroy all reactive method refs after 5 seconds
setTimeout(() => logNumber.unsubscribe(), 5_000);
```

AFTER:

```ts
const logNumber = rxMethod<number>(tap(console.log));

const num1Ref = logNumber(interval(1_000));
const num2Ref = logNumber(interval(2_000));

// destroy `num1Ref` after 2 seconds
setTimeout(() => num1Ref.destroy(), 2_000);

// destroy all reactive method refs after 5 seconds
setTimeout(() => logNumber.destroy(), 5_000);
```

### Schematics

#### Standalone is the default

(Container) components created by the Container Schematic are now standalone by default.
