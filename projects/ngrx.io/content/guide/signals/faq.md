  <summary><b>#1</b> How to connect my SignalStore(s) with Redux DevTools?</summary>

    There's no official connection between `@ngrx/signals` and the Redux Devtools.
    We expect the Angular Devtools will provide support for signals soon, which can be used to track the state.
    However, you could create a feature for this, or you can make use of the [`withDevtools` feature](https://github.com/angular-architects/ngrx-toolkit?tab=readme-ov-file#devtools-withdevtools) from the `@angular-architects/ngrx-toolkit` package.

  <summary><b>#2</b> Can I use the Flux/Redux pattern with SignalStore?</summary>

    Yes. Starting from NgRx version 19.2, the Events plugin introduces support for a Flux-style state management with SignalStore.
    It enables defining and dispatching events, handling them through reducers and effects, and maintaining a unidirectional data flow similar to the traditional Redux pattern.
    For more information, see the Events Plugin documentation.

  <summary><b>#3</b> Can I define my SignalStore as a class?</summary>

    Yes, it is possible to define a SignalStore using a class-based approach.
    However, the NgRx team recommends using the functional style for defining SignalStores.

    To define a class-based SignalStore, create a new class and extend from `signalStore`.

```ts
@Injectable()
export class CounterStore extends signalStore(
  { protectedState: false },
  withState({ count: 0 })
) {
  readonly doubleCount = computed(() => this.count() * 2);

  increment(): void {
    patchState(this, { count: this.count() + 1 });
  }
}
```

  <summary><b>#4</b> How can I get the type of a SignalStore?</summary>

    To get the type of a SignalStore, use the `InstanceType` utility type.

```ts
const CounterStore = signalStore(withState({ count: 0 }));

type CounterStore = InstanceType<typeof CounterStore>;

function logCount(store: CounterStore): void {
  console.log(store.count());
}
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>#5</b> Can I inject a SignalStore via the constructor?</summary>

    Yes. To inject a SignalStore via the constructor, define and export its type with the same name.

```ts
// counter-store.ts
export const CounterStore = signalStore(withState({ count: 0 }));

export type CounterStore = InstanceType<typeof CounterStore>;

// counter.ts
import { CounterStore } from './counter.store';

@Component({ /* ... */ })
export class Counter {
  constructor(readonly store: CounterStore) {}
}
```
