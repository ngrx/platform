# @ngrx/signals

NgRx Signals is a library for managing state and side effects with Angular Signals using helper utility functions to create state and stores based, and has opt-in interopability with RxJS.

## Key Concepts

State and side effects can be managed with `@ngrx/signals`:

### State

- `signalState`: a utility function to quickly create and operate on a piece of state.
- `signalStore`: a utility function to create and extensible store for more complex pieces of state.
- `patchState`: a utility function for update any Angular Signal immutability.

### Side Effects

- `rxMethod`: a utility function to create interopability with RxJS, to managing more complex async interactions.
