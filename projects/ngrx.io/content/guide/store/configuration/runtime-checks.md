# Runtime checks

Runtime checks are here to guide developers to follow the NgRx and Redux core concepts and best practices. They are here to shorten the feedback loop of easy-to-make mistakes when you're starting to use NgRx, or even a well-seasoned developer might make. During development, when a rule is violated, an error is thrown notifying you what and where something went wrong.

`@ngrx/store` ships with four (4) built-in runtime checks:

- [`strictStateImmutability`](#strictstateimmutability): verifies that the state isn't mutated
- [`strictActionImmutability`](#strictactionimmutability): verifies that actions aren't mutated
- [`strictStateSerializability`](#strictstateserializability): verifies if the state is serializable
- [`strictActionSerializability`](#strictactionserializability): verifies if the actions are serializable

These checks are all opt-in and will automatically be disabled in production builds.

## Enabling runtime checks

It's possible to turn on the runtime checks one by one. To do so, you must enable them while providing the root store. Use the `runtimeChecks` property on the root store's config object. For each runtime check you can toggle the check with a `boolean`, `true` to enable the check, `false` to disable the check.

```ts
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    StoreModule.forRoot(reducers, {
      runtimeChecks: {
        strictStateImmutability: true,
        strictActionImmutability: true,
        strictStateSerializability: true,
        strictActionSerializability: true,
      },
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### strictStateImmutability

The number one rule of NgRx, immutability. This `strictStateImmutability` check verifies if a developer tries to modify the state object. This check is important to be able to work with the state in a predictable way, it should always be possible to recreate the state.

Example violation of the rule:

```ts
export const reducer = createReducer(initialState,
  on(addTodo, (state, { todo }) => ({
    // Violation 1: we assign a new value to `todoInput` directly
    state.todoInput = '',
    // Violation 2: `push` modifies the array
    state.todos.push(todo)
  }))
);
```

To fix the above violation, a new reference to the state has to be created:

```ts
export const reducer = createReducer(initialState,
  on(addTodo, (state, { todo }) => ({
    ...state,
    todoInput: '',
    todos: [...state.todos, todo]
  }))
);
```

### strictActionImmutability

Uses the same check as `strictStateImmutability`, but for actions. An action should not be modified.

Example violation of the rule:

```ts
export const reducer = createReducer(initialState,
  on(addTodo, (state, { todo }) => ({
    // Violation, it's not allowed to modify an action
    todo.id = generateUniqueId();
    return {
      ...state,
      todos: [...state.todos, todo]
    }
  }))
);
```

To fix the above violation, the todo's id should be set in the action creator or should be set in an immutable way. That way we can simply append the todo to the current `todos`:

```ts
export const addTodo = createAction(
  '[Todo List] Add Todo',
  (description: string) => ({ id: generateUniqueId(), description})
);
export const reducer = createReducer(initialState,
  on(addTodo, (state, { todo }) => ({
    ...state,
    todos: [...state.todos, todo]
  }))
);
```

### strictStateSerializability

This check verifies if the state is serializable. A serializable state is important to be able to persist the current state to be able to rehydrate the state in the future.

Example violation of the rule:

```ts
export const reducer = createReducer(initialState,
  on(completeTodo, (state, { id }) => ({
    ...state,
    todos: {
      ...state.todos,
      [id]: {
        ...state.todos[id],
        // Violation, Date is not serializable
        completedOn: new Date(),
      },
    }
  }))
);
```

As a fix of the above violation the `Date` object must be made serializable:

```ts
export const reducer = createReducer(initialState,
  on(completeTodo, (state, { id }) => ({
    ...state,
    todos: {
      ...state.todos,
      [id]: {
        ...state.todos[id],
        completedOn: new Date().toJSON()
      }
    }
  }))
);
```

### strictActionSerializability

The `strictActionSerializability` check resembles `strictStateSerializability` but as the name says, it verifies if the action is serializable. An action must be serializable to be replayed, this can be helpful during development while using the Redux DevTools and in production to be able to debug errors.

Example violation of the rule:

```ts
const createTodo = createAction('[Todo List] Add new todo', todo => ({
  todo,
  // Violation, a function is not serializable
  logTodo: () => {
    console.log(todo)
  },
}))
```

The fix for this violation is to not add functions on actions, as a replacement a function can be created:

```ts
const createTodo = createAction('[Todo List] Add new todo', props<{ todo: Todo }>());

function logTodo (todo: Todo) {
  console.log(todo);
}
```
