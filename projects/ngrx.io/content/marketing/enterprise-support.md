### Architecture and code review
Let us go over the code and analyze the architecture of your web applications, and create a report with our recommendations. This can be done for the Angular applications that are already using NgRx or are interested to hear about how NgRx can help.

The in-depth report includes code quality assessment, runtime performance evaluation and test strategies evaluation.

### NgRx Support
Does your team need periodic help with general questions related to NgRx, Angular, and RxJS in a timely manner?

Is there a particular NgRx feature or a bug that your team would like to get prioritized?

Have you encountered an issue? With **NgRx support**, our team can assist either through email or video call in a reasonable time frame.

### Angular/NgRx consulting
When your teams need a more hands-on approach with the architecture and implementation of your Angular/NgRx app that follows best practices from a team of experts, then this is the right choice for your company.

Whether your team is starting with a greenfield project, is introducing state management into the app, or has been using NgRx for a while, we can help to ensure that the architecture is set up for scalability and performance while improving the app's code quality.

### Training
We also offer two or three full days of **NgRx workshop** that covers the basics of NgRx to the most advanced topics. Whether your teams are just starting with NgRx or have been using it for a while - they are guaranteed to learn new concepts during this workshop.

The workshop covers both NgRx global `Store` and `ComponentStore`.

Additionally, the following topics can be covered for your teams:

- How to set up Frontend teams for success with proper development processes.
- Testing Angular applications using unit and end-to-end tests.
