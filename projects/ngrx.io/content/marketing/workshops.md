Are you struggling to maintain and enhance your existing Angular applications? Do you want to harness the power of NgRx for state management and explore the cutting-edge features in Angular? Join us for in-depth workshops that will empower you to architect and modernize your apps with confidence!

Take your Angular and NgRx knowledge to the next level with [participating NgRx team members](#participating-ngrx-team-members).

## Enterprise Angular Architecture with NgRx and Signals

In the ever-evolving world of web development, staying ahead is crucial. This workshop offers a hands-on approach to mastering architecture and state management in Angular applications using both traditional NgRx patterns and the newer Signal-based approach. It is designed for developers, architects, and teams who want to revamp their existing Angular applications and leverage the latest advancements in Angular and NgRx ecosystems.

### Key Workshop Highlights

1. **Architectural Excellence:** Learn the art of crafting scalable, maintainable, and robust Angular applications. We'll delve deep into architectural patterns, best practices, and tools to structure your apps for success.
2. **Global NgRx Store:** Master the powerful state management solution for complex Angular applications. Explore actions, reducers, effects, and selectors to create a robust global state architecture that scales with your application needs.
3. **Angular Signals Mastery:** Gain an in-depth understanding of Angular's powerful reactivity system. Learn how to leverage Signals to create efficient applications while maintaining clean, readable code, and optimal performance.
4. **NgRx SignalStore:** Explore the fastest-growing state management solution in the Angular ecosystem. From foundational concepts to advanced techniques, learn how to leverage SignalStore's robust and extensible design to efficiently manage application state.
5. **State Management Patterns:** Understand the distinctions between local and global state as a prerequisite for developing well-designed applications that are easy to maintain and scale.

### Flexible Attendance Options

Choose the workshop option that best fits your team's needs:

- **Full NgRx Experience:** Attend all three days to learn NgRx from basics to the most advanced topics
- **Traditional NgRx:** Day 1 focuses on the proven patterns of global state management with NgRx Store
- **SignalStore Bundle:** Days 2 and 3 explore the exciting world of Signal-based state management

All days are designed to be independent and can be attended separately, although the complete three-day workshop provides the most comprehensive learning experience.
