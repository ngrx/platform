In the ever-evolving world of web development, staying ahead is crucial. This workshop is designed for developers, architects, and teams who want to revamp their existing Angular applications and leverage the latest advancements in the Angular ecosystem, including Signals.

Take your Angular knowledge to the next level with [participating NgRx team members](#participating-ngrx-team-members).

**Key Workshop Highlights:**

1. Architectural Excellence: Learn the art of crafting scalable, maintainable, and robust Angular applications. We'll delve deep into architectural patterns, best practices, and tools to structure your apps for success.

2. NgRx for State Management: Gain a comprehensive understanding of NgRx, the go-to library for managing state in Angular apps. We'll explore actions, reducers, effects, and selectors to create a robust state management system and how it influences apps architecture.

3. Introduction to Signals: Signals or NgRx? They work well together. Dive into one of Angular's most exciting features – Signals. Discover how Signals can streamline communication within your application, making it more responsive, efficient, and user-friendly.

Chose one, two or three full days of **NgRx workshop** that covers the basics of NgRx to the most advanced topics. Whether your teams are just starting with NgRx or have been using it for a while - they are guaranteed to learn new concepts during this workshop.

The workshop covers both NgRx global `Store` and local state management solutions like `ComponentStore` and `signalStore`.
