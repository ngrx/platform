## NgRx and Modern Angular Architectures

In the ever-evolving world of web development, staying ahead is crucial. This workshop is designed for developers, architects, and teams who want to revamp their existing Angular applications and leverage the latest advancements in the Angular ecosystem, including Signals.

### Key Workshop Highlights

1. **Architectural Excellence:** Learn the art of crafting scalable, maintainable, and robust Angular applications. We'll delve deep into architectural patterns, best practices, and tools to structure your apps for success.
2. **NgRx for State Management:** Gain a comprehensive understanding of NgRx, the go-to library for managing state in Angular apps. We'll explore actions, reducers, effects, and selectors to create a robust state management system and how it influences app architecture.
3. **Introduction to Signals:** Signals or NgRx? They work well together. Dive into one of Angular's most exciting features – Signals. Discover how Signals can streamline communication within your application, making it more responsive, efficient, and user-friendly.
4. **NgRx SignalStore:** Explore a cutting-edge state management solution with native support for Angular Signals. From foundational concepts to advanced techniques, learn how to leverage SignalStore's robust and extensible design to efficiently manage application state.
5. **State Management Patterns:** Understand the distinctions between local and global state as a prerequisite for developing well-designed applications that are easy to maintain and scale.
6. **Migration Strategies:** If you have an existing Angular application, we'll guide you through effective strategies for migrating to the latest version of Angular while improving your app's architecture.
