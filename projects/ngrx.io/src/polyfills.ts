/**
 * This file includes polyfills needed by Angular and is loaded before the app.
 * You can add your own extra polyfills to this file.
 *
 * This file is divided into 2 sections:
 *   1. Browser polyfills. These are applied before loading ZoneJS and are sorted by browsers.
 *   2. Application imports. Files imported after ZoneJS that should be loaded before your main
 *      file.
 *
 * The current setup is for so-called "evergreen" browsers; the last versions of browsers that
 * automatically update themselves. This includes Safari >= 10, Chrome >= 55 (including Opera),
 * Edge >= 13 on the desktop, and iOS 10 and Chrome on mobile.
 *
 * Learn more in https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/browser-support.html

/**
 * INTERNET EXPLORER
 *
 * All the Internet Explorer polyfills are defined separately, in the `ie-polyfills.js` file.
 * They are also built separately from the main app, via the `yarn build-ie-polyfills` task.
 * The output of this build is conditionally loaded (only if we are running IE) in the browser,
 * and executed before the rest of the application files are executed.
